      "Content: The previous three articles in this series (Parts 36–38) dealt with the acquisition of isochromatic fringe data from a photoelastic model, the conversion of isochromatic information to stress, and the transfer of the resulting stress amplitude data from the model to the prototype. We begin at last to wind down our discussion of photoelasticity by learning how stress directions are obtained from the model through the use of isoclinic fringes. Accuracy of the isoclinic data, as well as of some of the isochromatic data, depends on the care taken to calibrate your polariscope. This brief article extendsthe discussion of Part 35, which dealt with polariscope setups, and describes aquite simple approach to properly align the axes of the polarizers and quarter-wave plates. Explanatory commentary is added along the way, we hope to a tolerable degree, so that the reasons for each step are understood.

This specimen is the same as the one shown in Part 32 of this series, but the gamma of the image has been boosted toemphasize and narrow the zero-degree isoclinic so that it can be used for polariscope calibration.The feather-like structures are residues of the isochromatic fringes, and they assist in detectingasymmetry of the isoclinic.

      "Section: THE NEED FOR CALIBRATION\n",
      "Content: Experimentalists of superior breeding will always have in mind the following axiom: No data can be better than the calibration of the instrument used to acquire that data . Unfortunately, it is all too easy and too common to purchase an instrument (e.g. a thermometer, a testing machine, or a modal analysis system) and put it to use gathering experimental data without ﬁrst calibrating it or, at the least, checking the calibration data provided by the purveyor. That we get away with this practiceso often reﬂects credit onto the manufacturer of the apparatus; but the habit isfraught with risk, especially when dealing with instrumentation that is advancedin age or that has been moved or used by someone else. Many high-class research and manufacturing organizations require regular documented recalibration of measurement devices, especially in ﬁelds where safety is an issue. No data can be better than the calibration of the instrument used toacquire that data. •This axiom applies to allmeasurement apparatus, including optical devices. •It is not wise to trust the calibration provided by others.The calibration requirement applies to optical devices such as the photoelastic polariscope. Polarizing materials are sold with a label that identiﬁes the polarizing axis. Likewise quarter-wave ( λ/4) retarder stock usually has the ‘‘fast’’ or ‘‘slow’’ axis marked, but sometimes there is no indication which is which. In either case,experience shows that the markers provided are sometimes not quite correct.When purchased in large sheets, the axes of the materials might even vary overthe extent of the sheet. Further, when pieces are cut from the sheets so as to ﬁt them into set of polariscope mounting rings, the polarization or quarter-wave axis markers are usually lost. There is no way to correctly identify the important axesthrough simple visual inspection. If a pre fabricated polariscope is purchased, then it should be recalibrated at delivery and periodically after that in order to assure the accuracy of acquired data. The series, Optical Methods—Back to Basics , is written by University Distinguished Professor Gary Cloud of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. It began by introducing the nature and description of lightand will evolve, with each issue, into topics ranging from diffraction through phase shifting interferometries. The intent is to keep the series educationally focused by coupling text with illustrative photos and diagrams that can be used by practitioners in the classroom, as well as in industry. Unless otherwise noted, the graphicsin this series were created by the author. \n",

      "Content: the crossed polarizer and analyzer by only a half-degree or so and examine the resulting isoclinic fringe. To make the zero-degree isoclinic as narrow as possible, use a reasonably large load and the highest available level of light from the light source. White light will cause most of the isochromatics to wash out. If using a digital camera or a video imaging system, try a nonlinear response curve or just overexpose to nearsaturation of the image.Additional useful comments: •Sheets that combine a polarizer and a quarter-wave plate are available and are useful for simplepolariscopes. •The zero-degree isoclinic in a discis very sensitive to misorientationof the crossed polarizers, hence its usefulness as a calibration specimen. •Use a reasonably large load and intense light to narrow the isoclinic. •White light illumination will washout distracting high-orderisochromatics. •Nonlinear processing of the imagecan help sharpen the isoclinic. •Several alternative setups are possible. •Errors are reduced if the fast axes of the quarter-wave plates are kept crossed.Study of the photoelasticity equations (see Parts 31 and 34 of this series) indicates that several alternative arrangements of optical elements in the circularpolariscope are viable. The best setups are those that keep the axes of the quarter- wave plates crossed. The ‘‘fast’’ axis of one must coincide with the ‘‘slow’’ axis of the other. The reason is that it is difﬁcult to make perfect retarder plates, but itis simple to make them in pairs which have similar errors; all you need do is cut the pair from the same sheet. The ‘‘error’’ in a λ/4 plate is the amount by which the relative retardation deviates from exactly one-quarter of the wavelength. If the plates are used in matched pairs and their axes are kept crossed, then errors in isochromatic data will be minimized. In practice, it is not necessary toknow which are the fast and slow axes of each of the quarter-wave plates. The orientations of their axes and the crossed conﬁguration are easily established during the polariscope calibration with the disc as discussed above. Some of the concepts applied in calibrating a polariscope are useful in setting up other optical systems that involve pola rizers and retarders. For example, light from a laser is usually polarized, and polarization correction is often necessaryin systems for holographic interferometr y and digital speckle interferometry, to name two. \n",

      "Section: POLARISCOPE CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\n",
      "Content: The process of calibrating an ordinary transmission polariscope is outlined below. Some exceptions and modiﬁcations of the procedure might be appropriate,depending on the actual hardware at hand. Take heart; the calibration proceduretakes longer to describe than to perform.Assume that: •the polarizers and quarter-wave plates can be mounted loosely inholders that allow them to be rotated during calibration and then clamped, •the holders rest in mounts so that they can be independently rotated through known increments, •the mounts are attached to the polariscope chassis, likely using platforms that slide along anoptical bench, •the optical bench is level.We assume that the polarizers and quarter-wave plates can be mounted loosely in holders or rings that allow them to be independently rotated and then clamped into place once their axes are established. Further, the holders areassumed to rest in mounts that allow the elements to be independently rotatedby known angular increments after calibration. These mounts are attached to thepolariscope chassis, often via platforms that slide on the ways of an optical bench.The optical bench is assumed to be level with respect to earth. Beyond theseassumptions, we start from scratch with no prior knowledge of the orientationsof the principal axes of the optical elements. 1. Fabricate or obtain a calibration specimen. The idea is to use a model that will show a well-deﬁned known isoclinic fringe that is sensitive to misalignment of the polarizers. This goal can be attained by producing the zero-degree isoclinic in a model having an axis of symmetry for bothgeometry and loading. A disc of model material is easy to make and workswell as a specimen for calibrating polariscope elements. Diametral linescan be scratched on the disc surface to assist in alignment. 2. Set the empty holders to zero rotation angle in their mountings.3. Establish approximately the polarization axis of the polarizer. An easy way to do this is to treat it as a sunglass. Look through it at light, maybesunlight, that is reﬂected from a roadway or a body of water. That lightwill be somewhat horizontally polarized. Rotate the polarizer to produceminimum intensity of the reﬂected light. The polarizing axis will then beclose to vertical. Mark it with a piece of tape and mount it loosely in itsholder with its axis maintained as close to vertical as you can manage. 4. Repeat step 2 with the analyzer, but mount it so its polarization axis is horizontal. 5. Tweak the polarizers in their holders so as to produce minimum intensity of the transmitted light. This step assures that the polarization axes arecrossed. The human eye is very good at detecting this maximum darknessif working in a darkened room, but a photometric device can be used toadvantage. If a light meter is used, then the accuracy of the minimumlight setting can be improved by averaging the settings at which a givenintensity is produced on either side of the minimum. In any case, thepolarizer and analyzer are now crossed, but their axes are probably notabsolutely vertical and horizontal with respect to global coordinates. 6. Mount the calibration specimen in the load frame of the polariscope and apply sufﬁcient load to produce the desired isoclinic fringe. Arrange the disc so it is loaded in exact diametral compression and use a plumbline toassure that the loading is along the vertical.Calibration steps are summarized as follows: •Make or obtain a calibrationspecimen. ◦This specimen must show a well-deﬁned known isoclinic that is sensitive to misalignment of the polarizers. ◦A disc in exact diametral compression is commonly used. •Set the holders to zero rotation angle in their mountings. •Establish approximately thepolarization axis of the polarizerby creating extinction of obliquely reﬂected light. Mark this axis and mount the polarizer loosely in itsholder with its axis vertical. •Repeat the above step for theanalyzer, but mount it so its axis ishorizontal. •Get the axes of polarizer oranalyzer crossed by rotating onerelative to the other to create minimum intensity of the transmitted light. •Mount the calibration specimen in the load frame and apply load. ◦A plumb line assures that theload is along the vertical diameter. •Rotate the crossed polarizer and analyzer together to create the zero-order isoclinic in thespecimen image. ◦For a disc, the isoclinic will be across. ◦This step ﬁxes the polarization axes relative to earth.7. Establish the directions of the transmission axes of the polarizer and analyzer with respect to earth. Rotate the polarizer and analyzer togetherwithin their respective holders, keeping their axes crossed, until theisoclinic appears along the appropriate axes of the model. For a disc,it will look something like a Celtic cross, an example of which appearsin the photograph above. The transmission axes of the crossed polarizerand analyzer are thus known to be lined up parallel and perpendicularto the principal stress axes on the horizontal and vertical model axes.Symmetry requires that the principal stresses on these axes be paralleland perpendicular to these axes, so this procedure aligns the transmission axes of the polarizer and analyzer with respect to the specimen. Because the specimen load axis was set to vertical, the polarization axes now matchglobal horizontal and vertical. Carefully clamp the polarizer and analyzerin their respective holders. At this point, you have a properly calibratedlinear polariscope of the sort described in Parts 31-33 of this series. 8. Locate the directions of the transmission axes in the ﬁrst quarter-wave plate by placing it between the polarizer and the model. Rotate it within its \n",

      "Section: SOME DETAILS AND TIPS\n",
      "Content: Polarizing material containing a linear polarizer permanently laminated with a λ/4 plate already oriented at 45◦to the polarizer axis is often used for setting up simple polariscopes. If incident light strikes the λ/4 side ﬁrst, it will exit the other side as linearly polarized. If the light passes ﬁrst through the linear polarizer, thenthe transmitted light is circularly polarized. For calibration and for subsequentuse as a linear polariscope, set up these plates with the linear polarizer sides facing the model. When you are ready to convert to a circular polariscope, simply turn each plate around so that the λ/4 plates face the model. Alternatively, just swap the one for the other. While very convenient, these combined plates do notallow the options available when separate plates are used. Pieces of this material are, however, valuable as teaching aids. Each student can carry his/her own little polariscope in a pocket or purse. The reason that the disc in diametral compression serves so well for polariscope calibration is that the symmetry of the zero-degree isoclinic is very sensitive to misorientation of the crossed polarizers, and the human visual system is very sensitive to asymmetry in a pattern. To convince yourself of this fact, rotate \n",
